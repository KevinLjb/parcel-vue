# electron-releases 

> Complete and up-to-date info about every release of Electron.

This package:

- includes all [GitHub Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release) data about Electron.
- does not include draft releases.
- includes prereleases which are not published to npm.
- tracks which versions are published to npm.
- tracks [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) like `latest` and `beta`.
- includes V8, Chromium, and Node.js version data.
- includes [GitHub-flavored HTML](https://ghub.io/hubdown) for each release's changelog.
- ignores npm versions from the days before [Electron was `electron`](https://electronjs.org/blog/npm-install-electron).
- is [updated regularly](#updates).

## Installation

```sh
npm i electron-releases
```

## Usage

The module exports an array of release objects:

```js
const releases = require('electron-releases')

// find newest version:
releases[0].tag_name // => 'v1.8.2-beta.3'

// find `latest` on npm, which is not necessarily the most recent release:
releases.find(release => release.npm_dist_tag === 'latest')

// find `beta` on npm:
releases.find(release => release.npm_dist_tag === 'beta')
```

### Data

Each release contains all the data returned by the 
[GitHub Releases API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release), 
plus some extra properties:

- `version` (String) - the same thing as `dist_tag`, but without the `v` for convenient [semver comparisons](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#usage).
- `npm_dist_tag` (String) - an [npm dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) like `latest` or `beta`. Most releases will not have this property.
- `npm_package_name` (String) - For packages published to npm, this will be `electron` or `electron-prebuilt`. For packages not published to npm, this property will not exist.
- `total_downloads` (Number) - Total downloads of all assets in the release that 
  have a [detectable platform](https://github.com/zeke/platform-utils#api) in their
  filename like `.zip`, `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.rpm`, `.deb`, etc.
- `deps` (Object) - version numbers for Electron dependencies.
  - `v8` (String)
  - `chromium` (String)
  - `node` (String)
  - etc..

## Updates

This module is self-publishing. It runs in a 
[Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) 
process every ten minutes. A new version of this module is published if any of 
the following change:

- number of Electron releases on GitHub
- number of Electron releases on npm
- npm `electron@beta` version
- npm `electron@latest` version

If none of these has changed, the build process aborts and runs again ten minutes
later. For more detail, see [script/release.sh](script/release.sh)

The Heroku app is also synced to the GitHub repo, so every push to the
`master` branch will automatically deploy a new version of this app.

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
